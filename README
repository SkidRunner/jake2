Jake2 README
============

Jake2 is a port of the GPL'd Quake2 engine from id Software to Java. Jake2 is
distributed under the terms of the GPL (see LICENSE).

The port was done completely in Java. No native libraries are used for the
game functionality. We use the jogl Java OpenGL bindings for graphics rendering
and Java OpenAL (joal) for sound.

Jake2 is still under development. Send bug reports and feedback to
jake2@bytonic.de.

Currently Jake2 supports Linux and Windows2000/XP. We have feedback that it
works on OS X too with the right native jogl libraries.

requirements:
400 MHz CPU
Geforce2 MX or better graphics accelerator
JRE 1.4 or higher
